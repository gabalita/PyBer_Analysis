# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the analysis is to provide a holistic understanding of the relationships between drivers, riders, and fares within rural, suburban, and urban areas at Pyber. The analysis and data visualizations in turn will help stakeholders improve affordability and access to ride-sharing services.

## Results: 

**Figure 1.** Urban cities have a much larger supply of drivers and a higher demand for rides compared to suburban and rural cities. As a result, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is significantly lower in urban areas.

**Figure 2.** The average fare is plotted against the total number of rides for each city. Please note that the circle size correlates with driver count per city. Urban cities have higher ride demand and a higher supply of drivers.

**Figure 3.** The total fare earned within each city type is relatively consistent over time. That being said, urban centers still collect the most amount of revenue during each part of the year.

**Figures 4-6.** The following figures demonstrate that not only do Urban cities collect the most fares and experience the most rides, but also they have a higher proportion of drivers relative to their ride demand.

**Figures 7-9.** The following figures demonstrate the distribution of values for fares, driver count, and total number of rides for each city type.

## Summary: 
Based on the results, here are three business recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1) **Increase amount of drivers in suburban and rural cities.** Right now there are too many drivers servicing the urban cities. For example, urban cities only comprise 68.4% of total rides, but have roughly 86.7% of the total drivers working in those areas. Increasing the driver supply in the suburbs and rural areas would not only make ride-sharing more affordable for those areas, but also potentially increase the take home revenue for those drivers.
<br />
2) **Optimize driver supply based on seasonal demand.** Another area of opportunity could be optimizing driver supply to match demand for each city over the course of the year. Although ride demand within each city type is relatively consistent over the year (Figure 3), the demand does still oscillate to some degree. Adjusting driver supply can further improve affordability.
